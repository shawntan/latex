LaTeX
=====

Bunch of files I frequently use when I do anything in latex.

1. `homework.cls` class file for using Helvetica. Use `xelatex file.tex` to compile this.
2. `template.tex` sample file to start from.
3. `presentation_template` files to use for creating beamer presentations.


The `.gitignore` file in this repository is also useful when using git to version control your tex file.
